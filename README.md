This app is currently in alfa and designed to assist students in preparing for the Baccalaureate or exams at Romanian, Math, or Informatics. It features a secret game mode where you can learn while playing, intended as a premium feature. To access this game mode, you need to click 'Activate' and enter the code. The code is generated using an SHA-256 Upper Case hash of the following format: {username.ToLower()+("premium?forever")}. This app supports multiple users, allowing you to register or log in to an account.
There might be some terms within the app that are not fully defined. Feel free to test it out. I understand it's not perfect, but it was an enjoyable project that allowed me to test my skills and collaborate with my team: led by AkoForU(BackEnd), SanaBel(BackEnd), and Leonid_XAM_666(Design).
